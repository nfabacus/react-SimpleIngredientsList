# Simple Ingredients List using React

This is a very simple Ingredients List, for me to learn React.

## React skelton used
```
- react & react-DOM NPM packages
- Browserify -> allows the browser to use NPM modules
- Babel -> complies ES6/JSX into browser-readable Javascript
- Babelify -> allows you to use Babel with Browserify
- Babel-React-Preset -> tells Babel how to compile JSX, specific to React
- Watchify -> watches for changes and instantly starts compiling. Instant compiler
```
